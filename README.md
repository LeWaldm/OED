This codebase implements:
- abstract Experiment class for parametrized experiments
- constraining optim params (by simple transformations)
- sequential design choices in continuous design space


Examples:
- tissue with discrete EIG optim
- continuous indicator tissue with continuous optim
- DAD on 1D example
